> Programming a database is fascinating work.

## SQL Database

* [Megastore: Providing Scalable, Highly Available Storage for Interactive Services](http://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/36971.pdf) (2011)

> Megastore blends the scalability of a NoSQL datastore with the convenience of a traditional RDBMS in a novel way, and provides both strong consistency guarantees and high availability.

* [F1: A Distributed SQL Database That Scales](http://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/41344.pdf) (2013)

> F1 is a hybrid database that combines high availability, the scalability of NoSQL systems like Bigtable, and the consistency and usability of traditional SQL databases.

## NoSQL Database

* [Bigtable: A Distributed Storage System for Structured Data](http://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//archive/bigtable-osdi06.pdf) (2006)

> Bigtable is a distributed storage system for managing structured data that is designed to scale to a very large size.

* [Spanner: Google’s Globally-Distributed Database](http://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//archive/spanner-osdi2012.pdf) (2012)

> Spanner is Google’s scalable, multi-version, globally distributed, and synchronously-replicated database.

### Distributed Trasaction

* [Large-scale Incremental Processing Using Distributed Transactions and Notifications](http://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/36726.pdf) (2010)

> Percolator provides cross-row, cross-table transactions with ACID snapshot-isolation semantics.

### Distributed File System

* [The Google File System](http://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//archive/gfs-sosp2003.pdf) (2003)

> The Google File System demonstrates the qualities essential for supporting large-scale data processing workloads on commodity hardware.

### Raft Consensus Algorithm

* [In Search of an Understandable Consensus Algorithm](https://raft.github.io/raft.pdf) (2014)

> Raft is a consensus algorithm for managing a replicated log.

### Others

* [Logical Physical Clocks and Consistent Snapshots in Globally Distributed Databases](https://www.cse.buffalo.edu/tech-reports/2014-04.pdf) (2014)

> The hybrid logical clocks (HLC) that combines the benefits of logical clocks (LC) and physical time (PT) while overcoming their shortcomings.
