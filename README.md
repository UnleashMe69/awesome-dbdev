# SQL

## Schema

### Papers

- [Online, Asynchronous Schema Change in F1](papers/sql/F1-Schema.pdf) (VLDB, 2013)

  Introduces a protocol for asynchronous schema changes in distributed
  databases. The protocol executes a schema change in intermediate states and
  ensures that the transitions between these states are *consistency
  preserving*.

## Optimizer

### Papers

- [Access Path Selection in a Relational Database Management System](papers/sql/SystemR.pdf) (SIGMOD, 1979)

  Introduces a cost-based SQL optimizer in System R. The optimizer estimates
  the cost of access paths in terms of I/O and CPU costs, using statistics about
  the contents of each relation.

- [The Volcano Optimizer Generator: Extensibility and Efficient Search](papers/sql/Volcano.pdf) (ICDE, 1993)

  Introduces an optimizer generator that translates a model specification into
  optimizer source code. It also provides a search engine to be used in all
  generated optimizers. The search engine is goal-oriented using *directed
  dynamic programming* search algorithms.

## Execution

### Papers

- [MonetDB/X100: Hyper-Pipelining Query Execution](papers/sql/MonetDB.pdf) (CIDR, 2005)

  Introduces a CPU efficient query processor that employs a *vectorized* query
  processing model. The processor uses *loop-pipelined* and *cache-conscious*
  operations to take advantage of modern CPUs.
